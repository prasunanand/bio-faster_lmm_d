# Bio::FasterLmmD

A faster lmm for GWAS. GPU support coming soon.

NOTICE: this software is under active development. YMMV.

# Introduction

Faster_lmm_d is a lightweight linear mixed-model solver for use in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The original is similar to
FaST-LMM (an algorithm by Lippert et al.) and that code base can be
found [here](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm). Prof. Karl Broman
wrote a comparison with his
[R/lmmlite](http://kbroman.org/lmmlite/assets/lmmlite.html). Faster_lmm_d
and pylmm are part of the
[Genenetwork2](https://github.com/genenetwork) project. faster_lmm_d
can parse data in
[R/qtl2 format](http://kbroman.org/qtl2/assets/vignettes/input_files.html)
as input.


## Installation

In order to use the gem, you also need [faster_lmm_d](https://github.com/prasunanand/faster_lmm_d) tool installed.

Install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install bio-faster_lmm_d
